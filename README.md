# arduinoShiftLight
Arduino based programmable shift light

Originally a project created in 2014 sometime, had to rediscover on some disk of one of my machines recently.
Crafted for a project car that is just now ready for it's new dash. Still breadboarded in a bin in the garage :)

Looks like it's a replica of Chippernut's shift light, so making sure I link to his page
